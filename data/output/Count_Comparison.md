**Generated:** 2026-02-03 12:51:39

Comparing your counts with the User's Reference Table:

| Patha | Reference (Arsheyam) | Reference (Samam) | My Count (Arsheyam) | My Count (Samam) | Diff (Samam) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agneya | 124 | 182 | 125 | 181 | -1 |
| Tadvam | 122 | 200 | 124 | 199 | -1 |
| Brhati | 94 | 152 | 95 | 152 | 0 |
| Asaavi | 62 | 106 | 64 | 106 | 0 |
| Aindram | 105 | 186 | 105 | 186 | 0 |
| Pavamanam | 208 | 398 | 209 | 400 | +2 |
| **Total** | **715** | **1224** | **722** | **1224** | **0** |

**Observations:**

1.  **Total Count Matches:** The grand total of 1224 Samams is identical. This suggests the underlying data is consistent but the attribution to specific Pathas might differ slightly.
2.  **Agneya & Tadvam:** I am short by 1 Samam in each compared to the reference.
3.  **Pavamanam:** I have 2 extra Samams compared to the reference.

**Hypothesis:**
It's possible that the "missing" Samams in Agneya and Tadvam are being counted in Pavamana, or vice-versa, or there are boundary cases where a Samam is assigned to a different section. Or, simply, there are internal counting differences (e.g., one long Samam split into two, or two short ones merged).
