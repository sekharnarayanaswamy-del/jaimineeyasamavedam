## 💡 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| WordPress over custom code | Easier content management for non-technical users |
| Hostinger over Google Sites | Full WordPress functionality needed for plugins |
| Astra theme | Free, fast, highly customizable |
| Three personas | Addresses distinct visitor needs systematically |
| Release 1 scope | MVP approach allows faster launch, iterate based on feedback |
| Newsletter placeholder | Requires volunteer bandwidth, defer until capacity available |
| JSV-only gurukulams first | Focus on core mission, expand later |
